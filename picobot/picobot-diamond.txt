# pro tip: it always simpler than you think.

# Find the northern tip of the diamond:
0 x*** -> N 0
0 NExx -> W 0
0 NxWx -> E 0
0 NEWx -> S 1

# go all the way west, then all the way east.
1 **x* -> W 1
1 **W* -> E 2
2 *x** -> E 2

# at the eastern wall, nudge west,
2 *E** -> W 3

# then south, then repeat.
3 ***x -> S 1
