        I find it effective to divide my attention into no more than three places at any given time, and then have a goal in mind for each one. Here is what I'm working on now in three sectors of my life:
        <ol>
            <li>Friends &#38; family: for a hyper-intellectual and obsessively driven person, this is freally freaking hard... But mostly I'm trying to chill and hang out with my friends. That is my primary life goal at this point.</li>
            <li>Career: finishing my Associates degree in Computer Science, so that I can transfer to a university, finish a degree, and get my career taken care of, so that I can</li>
            <li>Be Creative: exploring ways to express ideas beyond songwriting. This site, for instance, is an experiment in prose and argumentâ€”in addition to being a fun personal exercise for my newfound coding skills. Filling this site with thoughtful articles is my most coherent creative goal at this point.</li>
        </ol>
