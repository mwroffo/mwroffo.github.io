## The Darkest of Reds

With a great shove at the door Kasey burst into the study.
“Huh? Hey, Kasey—what are you doing?” Kasey looked at the books under his arm, then back at his brother.
“Uh, hmm. Where can you sit?”
The only sounds were two bodies breathing and two pencils scratching through mountains of lined paper. Their father’s single stark desk-lamp was the only light in the room. One rifled through towers of flashcards. Another circled answers with little confidence. The elbow of a scrawny arm bumped another. A muscled arm slammed back. Paper ran across skin. The kid inhaled sharply and held his breath. The slightest sting throbbed under his skin as blood trickled up, as if from the faintest spring.
Leaving his papers, the kid rose. “I’ll drive myself tomorrow.” As he slammed the door behind him, the house shook.
Kasey did not watch him go but lowered his gaze. Considering his brother’s abandoned notes, his tense mouth eased into a mocking grin. Snatching up the stapled papers, he grabbed the cover sheet which would bear his brother’s name, tore it, crumpled it, and dropped it to the carpet. Remaining in the grim half-light from his father’s lamp, he broke his pencil lead again and again, and the sun descended, and the moon rose on his anger.

As Kasey’s head rested on hard walnut, his eyes darted around behind closed eyelids, and he breathed peacefully. His smile was blooming. One moment he stretched out his arms and closed them as if to surround something. They swung through air. Suddenly he cried out as pain shot from his knuckles and up his arm. Rubbing each eye with a fist, he planted his palms on the desk and shoved himself to his feet. He scanned his father’s study. As he gazed at the gleaming picture frames, degrees, and loaded bookshelves that lined the walls, all bliss drained from his expression. When he left, the grandest frame of all bore his fingerprints, and he wore the face of grim determination.

The kid hadn’t appeared. Wearing the slightest curve on his mouth, Kasey pushed through the gymnasium door. He seated himself in the first desk and aligned his pencils in a row.

“Today’s exam will be open-note,” the proctor said. Kasey produced a familiar stack of papers.
Kasey retrieved his cell phone from the proctor to find twenty missed calls from Father.
“How is he?” Kasey was breathing evenly. “...”

“...”
“How did you do?”
“It says perfect score.”
For many moments they each said nothing.
Behind father’s walnut fortress of a desk, Kasey sank into a leather throne. The chair would not roll. Inspecting the wheel he extracted a ball of paper. Uncrumpling it, he read aloud from a crude, childish hand: “Kasey Adams,” it said—And surrounding this script, an adornment in fingerprints and droplets, in the deepest and darkest of reds.
