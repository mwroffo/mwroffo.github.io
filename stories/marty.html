<p>“Me too I got an A- but they said that that wasn’t good—”</p>
<p>    “I know, right? But I was saying that I have a thousand followers now on my Insta-”</p>
<p>    “—and I said ‘Why not?’ and they said ‘because it’s not an A’, and I said it was an A, and they said that No, I needed to get all As with no—”</p>
<p>    “—and I saw that one of them was somebody sort of famous, a real live singer —”</p>
<p>“—And I said that well I am never good enough for you is it? And they said Ohhh no we don’t mean it like that, but I know that—”</p>
<p>“—And he even commented on me and Allie’s pictures from the beach saying we were cute—”</p>
<p>“—they’re actually thinking totally different stuff than what they say, you know?”</p>
<p> “…” </p>
<p> “Do you ever just feel like you’re not being listened to?”</p>
<p> “Yes!”</p></div>

    <p>WHEN MARTY EXHALES her breath is a ghastly haze. It never fogs the rear-view mirror, though, so tonight too she watches the horizon losing its rouge luster of dusk.        Swinging from this rear-view mirror there’s a fun-sized wooden cross. It’s rough on the edges. Lots of red pens in the the center cup holder. Always red. The backseat is a library. Self-help texts abound: Manson, “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck”. Tolle, “The Power of Now”, etc.</p>
    <p>The “way back”—her mother’s term—of the station wagon is scattered with industrial painting supplies: worn out brushes, “whizzy” rollers—the foam things as well as the arms—almost-empty paint buckets tipped over, spotted and speckled painters’ whites (canvas pants) of all sizes way too big, several company shirts printed in an insurance-friendly high-visibility piss-yellow, plus tools like putty knives, utility knives, and something called a 5-in-1.</p>
    <p> She’s got a self-help solve-identity-crisis sort of audiobook. She calls it a “book on tape”. She pops in the CD and starts saying her name: “I am Marty R. Dom. I’m a pain’er. I’ve been a pain’er <span id="ref1" class="FN_top"><sup> <a href="#fn1" title="go to footnotes">1</a></sup> </span>my whole life but my true passion is to help other people find themselves. I will always be a pain’er."  </p>
    <p>There are all kinds of titles looming behind her head: “Passionate: Finding Meaningful Living One Step Short of Crazy,” “Hesitant: How to Help your Addicted Patience <span id="ref2" class="FN_top"><sup> <a href="#fn2" title="go to footnotes">2</a></sup> </span> Find Their Passion by Exposing Hedonism as a sort of fear of just Being”; “Just Do It: How to Escape Pain by Finding the Courage to Make the Leap.”</p>
    <p>It doesn’t occur to Kasey Penn just how alarming it may be that Marty, who really is a woman and really does insist on being called Marty—this invitation to informality being printed bold on her business card—has got either (a) the entire lexicon of therapeutic psychology or (b) some kind of cleverly pre-selected shrink-bookshelf kit, plus her doctorate degree in a gleaming frame. Also a tiny cloth and bottle of polish posing beside it, not subtle at all.</p> 
    <p> Kasey stands by this point. She throws her hands dramatically into the air, and shouts with exasperated passion: “She’s always denying it, though! Always!”</p>
    <p>“Have you ever brought this up with your father?”</p>
    <p>“No—it’s not about my father.”</p>
