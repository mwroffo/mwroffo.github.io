    <p>When you ride the T, Everything just rumbles. But considering how many citizens are crammed down here it's surprisingly cool and quiet.</p> 

<p>Faces are multi-colored but all absent + screenlit, except this one old guy with a portable speaker and a lute. 
</p>
<p>It really is a lute, with its peculiar, pear-shaped body. It sends its humble vibrations. It waits for replies. It continues. </p>

<p>The manâ€™s wrinkles make like little valleys. A throng passes him by but his jingling trick-or-treat bucket is knocked over with a clunk, clink, and so he suddenly stops playing, bends down. </p>
<p> He's flipped the bucket back up and continued smiling.</p>
<p>
Nothing happened. But by this time the whole throng has passed him by and nobody skipped a breath to notice low Apollo, humming, smiling.</p>
