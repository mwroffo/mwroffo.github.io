    <p><b>Notes and excerpts from psychology books and articles.</b></p>

    <p>Social media and TV and the Internet are sometimes said to be the enemy of literary art (much as I like you, Jon Franzen). I liked the suggestion here idea that technology could actually <i>enable</i> new forms of narrative and <b>narrative therapy</b>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"for therapeutic practices: <b>instead of</b> helping the patient to (re)create a life story with an <b>overarching meaning</b>, it
        might be better to start from the little details, to ask them to <b>tell or write</b>, like Daudet did, <b>about little feelings</b>,
        impressions, observations (this could for instance be done by keeping a <b>notebook or a diary</b>)"</li>
        <li>"any medium that affords the presence of a reader or listener as well as <b>ways to capture the ‘ongoing’</b> could be used to
        chronicle chronic pain. We specifically think that <b>social media</b> such as blogs, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube <b>could be suitable </b>"</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>"Identity crisis is the result of role confusion and can cause the adolescent to try out different lifestyles"</li>
    </ul>
