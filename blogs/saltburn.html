<h2 id="saltburn-a-first-impression">Saltburn: a first impression</h2>
<p>Tell me if this sounds familar. There is a shy, unwitting ingenue... She/they long to meet their desires in a wider
    world, but they&#39;re lacking confidence; they need a guide, a push. Fortunately someone very handsome notices what
    an appealing person the girl really is, and also how overwhelmingly gifted she is --- just suffocated by tragic
    circumstance. Soon the very handsome person --- who is very popular and seems very nice. (Also he&#39;s rich.) He
    invites the girl to join him at his <em>mansion</em>; that way she doesn&#39;t have to go home to her abusive
    family. But then they get there and, there&#39;s something just not quite right about the mansion, the family, the
    groundskeeping staff.. There&#39;s something not right about <em>him</em>. Will she escape in time? <em>Snore.</em>
</p>
<p>In <em>Saltburn</em>, horror movie cliches are turned on their head. It&#39;s not a horror movie, per se --- it&#39;s
    a twisty, disturbing, <em>disturbed</em> dark academe thriller. It hits softly, then subtley, then all at once. It
    is not for kids. It&#39;s not really for us adults, either; it&#39;s supposed to make us uncomfortable, and it
    succeeds.</p>
<p>We meet Protagonist Oliver Quick on his arrival at Oxford. He is quiet and bookish: he&#39;s read more of the summer
    reading list than his advisor has. He gets in a verbal sparring match early on, but we basically like him and want
    him to make friends.</p>
<p>He doesn&#39;t really have any friends until one day he does something nice for Jacob Elordi&#39;s character, Felix
    Catton. Felix is so devilishly handsome and charming and popular that there <em>must</em> be something he&#39;s
    hiding.</p>
<p>Over the next year Ollie becomes friends with Felix. A jealous outcast tells Ollie &quot;he&#39;ll get bored of
    you&quot;, but we trust Felix; he seems just really decent. Ollie reveals some of his family hardships to Felix;
    they&#39;re so bad, Ollie doesn&#39;t think he can bear to return home at all. Felix evades a group of girls
    stalking him so that he can walk someplace quiet and talk with Ollie. They skip rocks. Ollie cries. Felix says
    &quot;Come to Saltburn.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Saltburn</em> takes its title from the lush extravagent estate of Felix Catton&#39;s neurotic family.
    And really, it&#39;s Felix&#39;s family.
    Passive aggressive jabs are the order of the day. Also the mother&#39;s backhanded compliments are so eerily
    reminiscient of Cersei Lannister&#39;s scheming that I mistook Rosamund Pike for Lena Headey. Oh and the partying.
    Sensuality like a Bosch painting. (Wearing Chanel, if they&#39;re wearing anything.)</p>
<p>Felix, meanwhile, seems so well adjusted that it&#39;s unsettling...
    and therein lies the film&#39;s central tension: it&#39;s too good to be true. Isn&#39;t it?
