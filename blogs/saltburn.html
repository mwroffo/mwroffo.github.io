<p><b>This review contains spoilers.</b></p>
<p>Tell me if this sounds familar. There is a shy, unwitting ingenue... She/they long to meet their desires in a wider world, but they're lacking confidence; they need a guide, a push. Fortunately someone very handsome notices what an appealing person the girl really is, and also how overwhelmingly gifted she is --- just suffocated by tragic circumstance. Soon the very handsome person --- who is very popular and seems very nice. (Also he's rich.) He invites the girl to join him at his <em>mansion</em>; that way she doesn't have to go home to her abusive family. But then they get there and, there's something just not quite right about the mansion, the family, the groundskeeping staff.. There's something not right about <em>him</em>. Will she escape in time?
<p>In <em>Saltburn</em>, horror movie cliches are turned on their head. It's not a horror movie, per se --- it's a twisty, disturbing, <em>disturbed</em> dark academe thriller. It hits softly, then subtley, then all at once. It is not for kids. It's not really for us adults, either; it's supposed to make us uncomfortable, and it succeeds.</p>
<p>We meet Protagonist Oliver Quick on his arrival at Oxford. He is quiet and bookish: he's read more of the summer reading list than his advisor has. He gets in a verbal sparring match early on, but we basically like him and want him to make friends.</p>
<p>He doesn't really have any friends until one day he does something nice for Jacob Elordi's character, Felix Catton. Felix is so devilishly handsome and charming and popular that there <em>must</em> be something he's hiding.</p>
<p>Over the next year Ollie becomes friends with Felix. A jealous outcast tells Ollie &quot;he'll get bored of you&quot;, but we trust Felix; he seems just really decent. Ollie reveals some of his family hardships to Felix; they're so bad, Ollie doesn't think he can bear to return home at all. Felix evades a group of girls stalking him so that he can walk someplace quiet and talk with Ollie. They skip rocks. Ollie cries. Felix says &quot;Come to Saltburn.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Saltburn</em> takes its title from the lush extravagent estate of Felix Catton's neurotic family.
And really, it's Felix's family.
Passive aggressive jabs are the order of the day. Also the mother's backhanded compliments are so eerily reminiscient of Cersei Lannister's scheming that I mistook Rosamund Pike for Lena Headey. Oh and the partying. Sensuality like a Bosch painting. (Wearing Chanel, if they're wearing anything.)</p>
<p>Felix, meanwhile, seems so well adjusted that it's unsettling...
and therein lies the film's central tension: it's too good to be true. Isn't it?
--- Emerald Fennell's character writing is on display, here ---</p>

<p>And the sister -- sadistically, in his ear -- calls Ollie a &quot;moth&quot; once she figures out that his grief at Felix's funeral was false --- But like Farley, she might not realize Felix's death was a conniving murder, not a convenient accident; she's underestimated him; shy quiet Ollie kisses her, as he opens her jugular noiselessly into the bathtub. She couldn't live without Felix, Ollie explains to the parents. They believe him.</p>

<p>So in the end, the most sick, twisted f&ast;ck in the story does turn out to be the shy quiet one.</p>
<p>The motive, not much substantiated gradually through the film, turns out to be Ollie's sheer resentment and hatred upon the social class that looks down on him at Oxford. The deaths reflect Ollie's judgment: apparent death by partying, apparent bathtub suicide. The father seems to die naturally, but we wouldn't put it past Ollie to have murdered him; Finally, the mother's murder is the most blatantly sadistic and cruel. Ollie reveals his evil nature, consumed by resentment, in a sililoquy he delivers to her unconscious body, on a hospital bed in a grand yet small room in the mansion. There's extravagent drapery and carpets.</p>
<p>In the end, it's poor Felix that we sympathize with; because in the end, Felix really is that kind. In the beginning we actually suspect him. By the end, he's the only character we feel a lot of sympathy for. Also Ollie's unwitting parents. Felix, in the end, seems to be someone so nourished by fortune, yet somehow uncorrupted by wealth and his senselessly cold family.</p>
<p>Felix has never learned to be suspicious. So even after he finds out what a pathological serial liar Ollie is, out of some decency, some misguided sense of final goodwill, Felix neglects to tell his family what Ollie's really like; he goes through with the birthday party, and is found in the morning, dead. In an &quot;accident&quot;.</p>
<p>Felix never realizes there was a war going on; and poor Felix loses. The innocent can never last.</p>
