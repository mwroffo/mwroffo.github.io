<p><b>This review contains spoilers.</b></p>
<p>Tell me if this sounds familar. There is a shy, unwitting ingenue... She longs to meet her desires in a wider world, but she's lacking confidence; she needs a guide, a push. Fortunately someone very handsome notices what an appealing person the girl really is, and also how overwhelmingly gifted she is &mdash; just suffocated by tragic circumstance. Soon the very handsome person &mdash; who is very popular and seems very nice. (Also he's rich.) He invites the girl to join him at his <em>mansion</em>; that way she doesn't have to go home to her abusive family. But then they get there and, there's something just not quite right about the mansion, the family, the groundskeeping staff... There's something not right about <em>him</em>. Will she escape in time?
<p>In <em>Saltburn</em>, horror movie cliches are turned on their head. It's not a horror movie, per se &mdash; it's a twisty, disturbing, <em>disturbed</em> dark academe thriller. It hits softly, then subtley, then all at once. It is not for kids. It's not really for us adults, either; it's supposed to make us uncomfortable, and it succeeds.</p>
<p>We meet protagonist Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) on his arrival at Oxford. He is quiet and bookish: he's read more of the summer reading list than his advisor has. He gets in a verbal sparring match early on, but we basically like him and want him to make friends.</p>
<p>He doesn't make any friends. Until one day he does something nice for Jacob Elordi's character, Felix Catton. Felix is the hot guy in the movie. He's charming and popular <em>and</em> kind and generous. No way. He's hiding something.</p>
<p>Over the next year Ollie becomes friends with Felix. A jealous outcast tells Ollie &quot;he'll get bored of you&quot;, but we trust Felix; he seems just really decent. Ollie reveals some of his family hardships to Felix; they're so bad, Ollie doesn't think he can bear to return home at all. Felix evades a group of girls stalking him so that he can walk someplace quiet and talk with Ollie. They skip rocks. Ollie cries. Felix says &quot;Come to Saltburn.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Saltburn</em> takes its title from the lush extravagent estate of Felix Catton's neurotic family.
And really, it's Felix's family.
Passive aggressive jabs are the order of the day. Also the mother's backhanded compliments are so eerily reminiscient of Cersei Lannister's scheming that I mistook Rosamund Pike for Lena Headey. Oh, and the bohemian partying. Like ancient Corinth. Sensuality like a Bosch painting. (Except Chanel, not togas.)</p>
<p>Felix, meanwhile, seems so well adjusted that it's unsettling...
and therein lies the film's central tension: it's too good to be true. Isn't it?
&mdash; Emerald Fennell's character writing is on display, here.</p>

<p>In the end, it's poor Felix that we sympathize with. We spend much of the film suspecting him; yet in the end, there's no catch. Felix really is that kind.</p>

<p>But it's his kindness that gets him killed. This is the film's tragic moral. You would think his senselessly cold family might teach him to be more suspicious.</p>

<p>Yet even after he finds out what a pathological serial liar Ollie is, out of some decency, some misguided final
goodwill, Felix neglects to tell his family what Ollie's really like. Felix is found in the morning, dead, in an
&quot;accident&quot;.</p>

<p>Felix, so nourished by fortune and seemingly uncorrupted by wealth. Naively trusting and recklessly kind... We love him. He never realizes there is a war going on; and so poor Felix loses.</p>

<p>Overall, Saltburn seems to show that sometimes the shy, quiet one isn't the victim. Sometimes they are behind it all.</p>

<p>The motive turns out to be Ollie's sheer resentment and hatred upon the social class that looks down on him at Oxford. The deaths reflect Ollie's judgment: apparent death by partying, apparent suicide in luxurious bathtub. The father seems to die naturally, but we wouldn't put it past Ollie to have murdered him.
</p>

<p>Finally, the mother's murder is the most blatantly sadistic. Ollie reveals the
resentment driving him, in a cruel sililoquy he delivers to her unconscious body on a hospital bed in a grand yet small room in the
mansion she left to him, Ollie, in her will.</p>
