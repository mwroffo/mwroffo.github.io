<p>As I returned to college this week, I sat through hours of introductory course material that I recalled perfectly.</p>

<p>This was frustrating because I had been genuinely excited to move on to new topics. But I was totally discouraged when I realized that in fact we'd spend the first three weeks relearning old news from last semester. I think a lot of curious students face this dilemma.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to sit around for the courses to catch up with my learning just because professors need to teach material at a particularly slow and agonizing pace to ensure that the entire class keeps up.”</p>

<p>And it occurred to me: maybe group classroom learning is inherently flawed. Since all students learn at different paces, it’s a goddamned miracle really, if a lecturer ever goes five minutes without some student getting lost. Then the student may raise their hand and ask the professor to explain. If perhaps most students had the same question, this is good procedure. But most of the time, I submit, most of the class already understood this. Therefore despite the frequent advice “Always ask, because another student probably has the same question,” in reality stopping the lecture for a question might be doing a disservice to most of the class, who already understand and want to get on with it. </p>

<p>Alternately however the student might not ask their question. So either many students had the same question and all limped home meekly, relieved that they didn’t have to admit their crushing incompetence in front of their peers. Or, as the student perhaps hypothesized: the question was in fact stupid since no one else was thinking it—in fact said peers were  damned glad that nobody interrupted the lecture to request that Prof perpetuate the gloom of banality by repeating stuff that’s basic.
</p>
<p>At any point in the lecture, <em> someone </em> in the classroom is either lost or bored.
</p>
<p>Point is, although the group lecture format is logistically convenient for administrations, students cannot win.
</p>
<p>Not to mention that every hour you spend listening to someone drone is an hour that you are not spending engaging actively with the material.
</p>
<p>So I’ve started taking as many courses online as possible, since it lets me freely manage <em> my </em> learning on <em> my </em> time.
</p>
<p>It does require far more self-discipline since no one is holding me accountable for showing up to a class time. But I count this as a good thing. Because rather than waiting for good things to happen to us, challenges like these force us to make things happen for ourselves.
</p>
<p>After all, I realize, high school didn’t exactly represent the real world when teachers used to remind us about missing assignments, etc.
</p>
<p>In reality, we need to take responsibility for creating positive change when something isn’t working for us. </p>

<p>For example, since I wanted to learn more stuff I just bought some additional non-college-affiliated online courses to fill my extra time. Done.</p>

<p>It's almost like sometimes the only person keeping you in a bad situation is you.</p>

<p> The solution, then, is not to get frustrated, but to push on ahead. Go your own pace, and no one else’s, even if that means going faster.
</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur/mentor once advised me, “be your own boss.” That way, nothing and no one is the boss of you.
