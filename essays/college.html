<h2>An Empty Cup</h2>
<h4>Or: the last two years of my life in ~500 words</h4>
<p id="gray_subtitle">March 22, 2017</p>
<p>
Senior year, I became captivated with songwriting. I scribbledÂ lyrics on my assignments. Brought my guitar to school. Stayed home practicing on prom night.</p>
<p>
I enrolled in music at Belmont University, not because I was intended to apply myself meaningfully to any curriculum whatsoever, but because my parents&#39;s insisted on me earning a degree and I felt incapable of focusing on anything else<span id="ref1" class="FN_top"><sup> <a href="#fn1" title="go to footnotes">1</a></sup> </span>. I left school after a year in order to out-rehearse everyone else. After all, since when did rock &#39;n&#39; roll have anything to do with getting an A?</p>
<p>
Determined to make my passion my career, I moved to the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. I went to work, then to rock clubs (five nights a week), got home, worked on my own songs until I fell asleep. Then I did it again.</p> 
<p>This went on from May through November. Two years of relentless drive culmilated in a <a href="http://feelslikethis.bandcamp.com/" title="bandcamp link" target="_blank"> November EP release.</a> </p>
<p>
This was weird. Suddenly I felt done. Other curiosities like programming, drawing, and essay-writing tugged at my attention. With no other plan for my livelihood, I kept songwriting through January, but my passion had became a stale job. So I took a two-month break and enrolled in some science courses.</p>
<p> And what was weird/surprising was that focusing <em>less</em> on music made my life deeper and happier. In truth I had been repressing other curiosites like code, political science, and short-story writing for years because I believed that only a single-minded devotion could make me successful in music.
<p> Not having the freedom to pursue those curiosities was arousing the same crushing dread as when I was overscheduled at my preparatory high school and having no time for music.</p>
<p> Maybe the fulfillment recipe for bright and broadly-curious people, then, is not to slot ourselves into a single hyper competitive scene, but to learn some valuable skills that we can barter for a livable salary, which will allow the freedom to pursue our creativity and curiosities exactly the way we want to.</p>
<p> As Author Elizabeth Gilbert (best known for "<a href="http://a.co/iHXJmqJ">Eat, Pray, Love</a>") put it: if you love your creativity, why would you ever burden it by demanding that it pay the bills?</p>
<p> Furthermore I have noticed that as my music has improved vastly over these last two years of obsession, it&#39;s not the success itself, or even the admiration of peers, that makes it all worthwhile.</p>
<p> It&#39;s the positive emotion that comes from working on something meaningful, together, with your best friends in the world.</p>
<p> It&#39;s weird because when I was eighteen, I was dead sure that I&#39;d never change my mind about music. But since that epiphany, I&#39;ve lost all interest in big musical fame + glory, while my family and my friends have become <em>really</em> important. I only expect this emotional trend to continue through my twenties. </p>
<p> It reminds me of ten-year-old Michael, smaller but similarly confused, sitting on my parents&#39; hardwood floor by the fireplace watching the Pixar movie Cars by myself. The cocky rookie Lightning McQueen could not conceive of anything more important than success and glory.</p>
<p> But as Doc Hudson puts it: "It's just an empty cup."</p>

                <span id="fn1"> It&#39;s a topic for another time, but I intend to write something long and generalized about how the hell young people can decide what their own best relationship to their creativity is, whether its a hobby, a craft, or a career. I mean maybe following your passion does not necessarily mean following it into the workforce.</span>
