<article class="markdown-body"><h1>Single and Double-Comparions in Binary Search (Algorithms)</h1>
<p>In <em>The C Programming Language (2nd Ed.)</em>, Kernighan, Ritchie present this implementation of binary search:</p>
<pre><code>/* Given needle x, and sorted haystack v (linear data structure like array or list), return location of needle */
int binsearch(int x, int v[], int n) {
    int low, mid, high;

    low = 0;
    high = n - 1;

    while (low &lt;= high) {
        let mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (x &lt; v[mid]) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else if (x &gt; v[mid]) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            return mid; // found it
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>They then challenge us to eliminate one of the comparisons from inside the while loop. Do some examples on paper. Can you see it?</p>
<p>Test expressions (e.g. these comparisons) gather information, so that our program can make correct choices. How can we reduce necessary comparisons? By identifying valid assumptions.</p>
<p>By considering how the algorithm deals with the not-found case, we can investigate how the algorithm might be doing unnecessary work, because we haven't identified a valid assumption. As currently formulated, every iteration tests explicitly for exact-match with a double-comparison implementation: when <code>v[mid] &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= v[mid]</code>, terminate the loop and return immediately. This saves time when <code>x</code> exists in <code>v</code>. But our worst-case time complexity is <em>much</em> worse, performing twice the comparisons, and we <a href="https://youtu.be/e3-5YC_oHjE">still haven't found what we were looking for</a>.</p>
<p>Failure, in other words, is expensive. Very expensive. So let's relax our loop's purpose, such that not-found does not impede performance. Rather than finding <code>x</code>, lets have our loop simply narrow our search area as much as possible: to a single index. Whether we have the case <code>x-found</code>, or <code>x-not-found</code>, our loop refines the assignments of our indices <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> until they are equal: <code>low == high</code>, which causes the loop to exit by breaking the new loop condition, <code>low &lt; high</code>.</p>
<p>By the time the loop does exit, we have found an element which either is x, or is as close as we can get to x. One simple additional test outside the loop reveals which case we have: <code>(x == v[low]) ? low : -1</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we are working outside the loop to distinguish the <code>found</code> case from the <code>not-found</code> case, we no longer need a two-comparison approach. Consider: the boolean expression <code>x &lt;= v[mid]</code> means (quite literally) that either <code>x == v[mid]</code> or <code>x &lt; v[mid]</code>; since x is no greater than v[mid], there is no need to check for it above mid, so we can eliminate the second comparison which was allowing for this possibility. We iteratively narrow our search area with just one comparision. Observe:</p>
<pre><code>/* one-comparison binary search */
int binsearch(int needle, int haystack[], int n) {
    int low, mid, high;

    low = 0;
    high = n-1;

    while (low &lt; high) {
        mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (needle &lt; haystack[mid])
            high = mid - 1;
        else
            low = mid;
    } // where low==high
    return (needle == haystack[low]) ? low : -1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>By thinking more carefully about what work our loop should do, and by identifying and eliminating extraneous work, we achieve O(log n) time in best and worst cases.</p>
